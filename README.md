 [Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning]https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rBvCIew-iHIXaAeKrahXC9LJGFK-A-J4?usp=sharing


## Goal: 
To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant based on a given dataset of features. Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and survival rates.

## Description:
The project involves:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Collecting and preparing a suitable breast cancer dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features to ensure data quality and consistency.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features from the dataset that contribute significantly to the classification task, potentially creating new features to enhance model performance.

Model Selection and Training: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to identify the most effective model for the given dataset.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the chosen model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and conducting cross-validation to ensure model reliability.

Model Deployment: Integrating the trained model into a user-friendly interface or application for real-world implementation.
By successfully completing these steps, the project aims to create a valuable tool for assisting healthcare professionals in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.
